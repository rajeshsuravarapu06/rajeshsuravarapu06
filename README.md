## 🚀 About Me

I’m a dynamic and results-driven **Cloud & DevOps Engineer** with over **7+ years of experience** designing, automating, and managing scalable cloud environments — primarily on **AWS&GCP**.

I specialize in:

- ✅ CI/CD automation with tools like **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, and **Jenkins**
- ✅ Containerization using **Docker** and orchestration with **Kubernetes**
- ✅ Cloud-native security, networking, and monitoring

With a strong foundation in **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** principles, I focus on reliability, scalability, and performance optimization across cloud platforms.
